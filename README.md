Crowd Counting Using LCDnet on CARPK Dataset
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for vehicle crowd counting using the LCDnet architecture on the CARPK dataset. The model aims to accurately predict the number of cars in aerial images by generating density heatmaps and summing them for final count estimation.

üîç Project Overview
Objective: Estimate the number of vehicles in parking lot images using density map regression.

Lightweight CNN design (LCDnet)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as evaluation metrics

 Motivation
Traditional object detection methods often struggle in dense scenes where objects (like vehicles or people) are heavily occluded or closely packed. This project explores the use of LCDnet, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture tailored for density map-based crowd counting, which can outperform bounding-box approaches in such conditions. By predicting a smooth density map instead of exact object locations, the model becomes more robust to overlaps and scale variations.

üß™ Methodology
The project pipeline starts with preprocessing the CARPK dataset, which includes aerial images of parking lots with annotations. Ground truth heatmaps are generated by placing a Gaussian kernel at the center of each annotated bounding box. These heatmaps represent the spatial distribution of objects in the scene. During training, the LCDnet model learns to predict these heatmaps from input images. After training, the total vehicle count is computed by summing over the values in the predicted density maps.

üöÄ Why LCDnet?
LCDnet (Lightweight Crowd Density Network) is designed to be computationally efficient without compromising accuracy. It uses a compact architecture with fewer parameters, making it suitable for real-time or resource-constrained applications like drones, surveillance systems, or mobile devices.
